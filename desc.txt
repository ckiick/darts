The Darts Problem

Suppose that you have a dartboard that is divided into R regions. Each
dartboard region has a positive integer value associated with it. Further
suppose that you have D darts and that you throw each of them at the dartboard.
Each dart either lands in one of the board's R regions or misses the board
altogether. Your score is the sum of the values for the regions in which the
darts land. A dart that misses the board contributes nothing to your score. If
multiple darts land in the same region, you accumulate the value for that
region multiple times.

For example, suppose that R = 5, that the dartboard regions have values (1, 2,
4, 7, 11), and that D = 3. If your three darts land in regions 2, 4 and 11 you
score 17 points. If one dart misses the board and the other two land in region
7 you score 14 points.

The Darts Problem is this: for a given R and D, determine what values should be
associated with a dartboard's R regions in order to maximize the smallest score
unattainable by throwing D darts.

For example, again suppose that R = 5 and D = 3. If you choose the values (1,
2, 4, 7, 11) for the board's 5 regions, then the smallest score unattainable
with your 3 darts is 27. But if you choose the values (1, 4, 6, 14, 15) the
smallest unattainable score is 37. The second choice of values is therefore a
better choice for 3 darts and 5 regions.

By the way, the Darts Problem is more commonly known as the Postage Stamp
problem, wherein you are asked to determine which R denominations of stamps to
issue in order to maximize the smallest postage unattainable with D stamps.
The Contest

Submit (see How to Enter, below) your best solutions to the Darts Problem for
the following values of R and D:

D = number of darts 	R = number of dartboard regions
3 	1 through 40
4 	1 through 30
5 	1 through 20
6 	1 through 10

Thus, there are 100 problems and you are asked to submit 100 solutions. You can
submit more than one solution for the same problem, but if you do we count only
your best solution. There is no penalty for submitting multiple solutions for
the same problem.

See The Scoring System, below, to learn how we determine the winner.
The Prizes

The prizes are metal sculptures by Bathsheba Grossman. The 1st place winner has
his pick from among the larger ones, and 2nd place chooses from the smaller.
How to Enter

Just paste your solutions into the large box on the Submit page and click
Submit. Format your solutions as follows:

    An individual solution consists of
        a number (representing the number of darts), followed by
        a colon, followed by
        a comma-delimited list of region values.

    Submit multiple solutions in a single batch by separating them with
    semicolons. Do not place a semicolon after your last solution.  Include
    spaces and line breaks anywhere you like (except within a number) to
    improve readability.

There's an example of an entry in the Frequently Asked Questions section, below.

Do not submit entries under more than one account. This is important. Do not
submit entries under more than one account.  The Scoring System

Each time you submit a solution we will merge it with your prior solutions, if
any. The result will be a virtual entry containing your best solutions for each
of the 100 problems. We will give each of these 100 solutions a subscore from 0
to 1 and their sum will be your contest score.

We score the individual solutions as follows. If your solution is the best that
was submitted for that problem, we give it 1 point; otherwise we give it only a
fraction of a point. The fraction is the solution's smallest-unattainable-score
divided by the best smallest-unattainable-score submitted by anyone for that
same problem.

In case of a tie, preference is given to the entrant whose latest improved
solution was submitted least recently.

Let's walk through a simplified example. Suppose that we reduce the contest to
only 3 problems -- finding the dartboard regions that maximize the smallest
unattainable score in these cases:

4 darts, 2 regions
4 darts, 3 regions
4 darts, 4 regions

Further suppose that we have only 3 entrants (Dana, Pat and Syd) and that these
are their best solutions for each of the 3 problems:

	Dana 	Pat 	Syd
4 darts, 2 regions 	1, 2 	1, 3 	1, 4
4 darts, 3 regions 	1, 4, 7 	1, 2, 3 	1, 3, 5
4 darts, 4 regions 	1, 3, 5, 7 	1, 4, 7, 10 	1, 2, 3, 4

The smallest unattainable scores corresponding to these solutions are:
	Dana 	Pat 	Syd 	Best Solution
4 darts, 2 regions 	9 	11 	11 	11
4 darts, 3 regions 	17 	13 	17 	17
4 darts, 4 regions 	23 	23 	17 	23

The total scores for each entrant are computed as follows:
	Dana 	Pat 	Syd
4 darts, 2 regions 	9/11 = 0.82 	11/11 = 1.00 	11/11 = 1.00
4 darts, 3 regions 	17/17 = 1.00 	13/17 = 0.76 	17/17 = 1.00
4 darts, 4 regions 	23/23 = 1.00 	23/23 = 1.00 	17/23 = 0.74
Total 	2.82 	2.76 	2.74

Finally, the standings page listing is as follows:
Rank 	Score 	Contestant
1 	2.82 	Dana
2 	2.76 	Pat
3 	2.74 	Syd

Can you give an example of an entry?

Here's an entry that contains a single solution. It's for 3 darts and 7 regions.
 3: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21

Here's another entry that contains solutions for 5 of the problems, some of
which are for 4 darts and some of which are for 5. Note that the last solution
is not ended with a semicolon.
 4: 1; 4: 1,2; 4: 1,3,4; 5: 1,2; 5: 1,2,3

The immediately preceding solution could also be split across 5 lines for added
readability. 4: 1;
4: 1,2;
4: 1,3,4;
5: 1,2;
5: 1,2,3

Can teams enter the contest?

Collaboration is allowed. However, only one of the collaborators may register.
If two contestants are found to have collaborated, even if this occurred before
one or both registered, both will be disqualified.

What information about my solutions can I share in the discussion group?

There are two types of information that you are forbidden to post. The first is
specific solutions. The second is code. You may post scores, so if you want to
tell everyone that you got a raw score of 4999 for (3 darts, 20 regions), go
right ahead. You may also discuss the algorithms you are using.

How can I find out my subscores for the 100 individual problems?

You can't. Seriously.

Can I enter the contest more than once, using different names?

No. Nor can you enter more than once using the same name.

How do you know which questions are going to be asked frequently, before any
questions have been asked?

It's a gift.
